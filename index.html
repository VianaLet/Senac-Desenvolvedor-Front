            <h2>What is salary packaging?</h2>
            <p>Salary packaging (also known as salary sacrifice) is an Australian Taxation Office (ATO) approved benefit that allows you to pay for certain items with your pre-tax salary.</p>
            <p>That means you could pay less tax, and keep more of your income when you salary package</p>

            <h2>Why choose salary packaging?</h2>
            <p>Salary packaging is a key employee benefit to help you reduce the amount of income tax you pay, meaning you have more money to spend. Your employer determines the range of expenses that can be included in your salary packaging program but these are usually everyday items that you're already paying for.</p>
            <p>Use the salary packaging calculator to find out exactly how much you could save.</p>
